# data-science-learning-path
Welcome to my Data Science Learning Path! Here, you'll find a mix of exercises and projects where Iâ€™ve dived into data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and machine learning. Each project is clearly documented, making it easy to follow along. Feel free to explore and see my progression and skills!
